/**
 * @class SubscriptionManager
 * @brief Manages subscriptions, accounts, vehicles, and related operations for the system.
 *
 * The `SubscriptionManager` class provides functionality for managing subscriptions, accounts, and vehicles within the system.
 * It allows for tasks such as adding and removing subscriptions, verifying account credentials, handling vehicle subscriptions,
 * processing payments, and more. The class also handles temporary account-related data such as recovery tokens, account updates,
 * and temporary account creation. It is designed to interact with a database for data persistence and updates, and it uses background
 * threads to periodically perform maintenance tasks such as removing expired tokens.
 *
 * The class includes methods for retrieving account details, adding subscriptions, managing vehicles, and handling user and admin
 * operations. It also allows for newsletter subscriptions, password recovery, and account updates, ensuring that the internal data
 * remains consistent and synchronized with the database.
